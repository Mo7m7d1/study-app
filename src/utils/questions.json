			"question": "What do we mean by the Relational database modeling process?",
			"answer": "Relational database modeling process means – normalization, relations or tables are progressively decomposed into smaller relations to a point where all attributes in a relation are very tightly coupled with the primary key of the relation. First normal form: data items are atomic, Second normal form: attributes fully depend on primary key, Third normal form: all non-key attributes are completely independent of each other."
		},
		{
			"id": 9,
			"question": "What do we mean by the process of normalization in general?",
			"answer": "The process of normalization generally breaks a table into many independent tables. A normalized database yields a flexible model, making it easy to maintain dynamic relationships between business entities."
